You're free to use everything that I made in whatever way you like. Please let me know if you find any of it useful :) 

Everything in this repository was made by me (Aleksy Jones), with the following exceptions:

1. The stb image library (stb_image.h, stb_image.c), used to load in texture images. The API takes a filename, and provides pointer to image data. Public domain 'license' in the source files.

2. The Eigen Matrix library, which I only use to invert a matrix once, but didn't have time to remove. LGPL, http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

3. the google protobuf Library, used to package+serialize distance field fonts. 3-clause BSD License, https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/

4. SDL v1.2, used for window + event management. LGPL, http://libsdl.org/index.php
